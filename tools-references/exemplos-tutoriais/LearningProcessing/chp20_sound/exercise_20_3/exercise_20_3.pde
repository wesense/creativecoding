// Exercise 20-3: Expand the Doorbell class to animate (perhaps moving its location and changing its size randomly) only while its sound is playing. Create an array of five Doorbell objects. Here is part of a function to add to the Doorbell class:

/*
void jiggle() {
  if (_________________)) {
    x += ____________;
    y += ____________;
    ________________;
  }
}

## Draw a picture made of ellipses and rectangles!

For example, you could make a self-portrait, an alien creature, or something more abstract. It'll just be black and white for now, we'll get to color in the next video.

You can work on your own pace, but we recommend approximately ten minutes on this assignment before moving on.

** Reminders **

To draw a rectangle: rect(a,b,c,d);

To draw an ellipse: ellipse(a,b,c,d);

> a — X (horizontal) location of the shape's upper-left corner

> b — Y (vertical) location of the shape's uppper-left corner

> c — width of the shape

> d — height of the shape
